    <h1 style="color: red;" >My Childhood</h1>
    <h4>My childhood history  is full of very happy memories <br>
         and also very sad ones.
         I enjoyed my young age life with my mother Mary, DAD Kamau,
          my brother John and my sister Agnes. <br>
           I come from a humble background   <br>
           where we used to survive for livelyhood.
        <br>We used to walk over along distance to look for water and firewood. <br>
        Me and my siblings we used to start our journey of 10km in the morning to look for firewood. <br>
        We were supporsed to be back before 12 o'oclock. <br>
        Later in the day after lunch my brother was to take our cattles to the feild to graze. <br>
        Me,my sister and mum we would go to fetch water in the
         river that was 5km away from home. <br>
        That was for the days that we were at home for school holidays. <br>
        School days parents could try and manage themselves to give us ammple time to go to school.<br> 
        This helped me to be hardworking and eager to learn nd change someone's life.
    </h4><h3 style="color: red;">Family Interactions</h3> <h4>
    During holidays my cousins used to come to our home we would spend good time with them. <br>
    Especially during rain season we would run on the rain, <br>
    slide on mad and trap small insects which as a result of rain. <br>
    We would cook the insects behind our parent's back and 
    eat them with ugali. <br>
